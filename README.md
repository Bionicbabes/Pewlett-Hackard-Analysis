**The Number of Retiring Employees by Title**
------------------------------------------

- As many employees start to reach the retirement age our boss has given us a task to create a "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.  
- 
- To start we were given the following six spreadsheets containing company data from HR.  We started with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to establish how all the data was connected and how we will reference the data between tables.
