- **The Number of Retiring Employees by Title**
------------------------------------------

- As many employees start to reach the retirement age our boss has given us a task to create a "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.  Below is the table.
